   same points, because glibc's is fdlibm with corrections that do not change
   the accuracy.  What the optimized variant buys here is 13 percent of the run
   time at identical code size, not precision; the accurate one misses none, at
   5.5 times the code and four times the run time.  One budget for both of the
