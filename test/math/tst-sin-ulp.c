/* Measured over the points of the table: fdlibm misses the correctly rounded
   result 26 times for sin and 20 for cos, CORE-MATH none.  There is no
   optimized and no accurate variant -- Arm's optimized-routines has no portable
   scalar sin or cos, and CORE-MATH's carry their argument reduction in a real
   128-bit integer, which 22 of our 34 toolchains cannot compile -- so all three
   settings are the same fdlibm code and share one number.

   Those 26 and 20 hold on every target only because libm/s_sin.c and s_cos.c
   put the x87 at 53 bits for the duration of the call: the reduction carries
   pi/2 in two words and needs each operation rounded to double.  Without that,
   i686 misses 53 and 68 -- the damage is in the reduction, 46 of the 68 in the
   block beyond 2^20 where __kernel_rem_pio2 runs.  The slack over the
   measurement is for targets where the compiler contracts a multiply and an add
   into one instruction.  */
