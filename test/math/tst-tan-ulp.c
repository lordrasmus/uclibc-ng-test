/* Measured over the 999 points of the table: fdlibm misses the correctly
   rounded result 19 times, CORE-MATH none.  There is no optimized and no
   accurate variant -- Arm's optimized-routines has no portable scalar tan, and
   CORE-MATH's carries its argument reduction in a real 128-bit integer, which
   22 of our 34 toolchains cannot compile -- so all three settings are the same
   fdlibm code and share one number.

   That 19 holds on every target only because libm/s_tan.c puts the x87 at 53
   bits for the duration of the call: the reduction carries pi/2 in two words
   and needs each operation rounded to double.  Without that, i686 misses 135,
   99 of them in the block beyond 2^20 where __kernel_rem_pio2 runs.  The slack
   over the measurement is for targets where the compiler contracts a multiply
   and an add into one instruction.  */
