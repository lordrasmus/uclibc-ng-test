/* Shared harness for the tst-*-ulp tests.

   Each of those checks one function against correctly rounded results that were
   computed on the host (see gen/), because the guest has no reference of its
   own: uClibc-ng's long double is a wrapper around double on most ports, so
   expl is the very function under test.

   How far a result may stray from that reference depends on which
   implementation the library was configured with -- UCLIBC_LIBM_SMALL,
   _OPTIMIZED or _ACCURATE.  A test therefore states three budgets and lets
   BUDGET() pick the one in force.

   The float and long double entry points are not separate implementations:
   libm/w_*f.c and libm/ldouble_wrappers.c compute in double and convert.  So
   they are checked against the same setting, and against a table of their own
   only where the conversion can round a second time.  */
