/* mmap() with an offset that does not fit a 32-bit argument.
 *
 * The point of this test is the offset, not any particular file: on 32-bit
 * targets an offset near 4 GiB can only be expressed through the mmap2
 * syscall, which takes it in pages, so this exercises the conversion in the
 * C library.  It used to map the fixed physical address 0xfffff000 out of
 * /dev/mem, which is not a property of the library at all -- whether
 * anything mappable lives there depends on the platform, and the test was
 * switched off for arm, riscv32 and xtensa one architecture at a time.
 * Licensed under the LGPL v2.1, see the file COPYING.LIB in this tarball.
